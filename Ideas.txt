Idea1: Find The Best City For You
     
     A city's livability can be rated from many apects: crime rate, employment rate, cost of living, education, convinience culture etc.
Normally a city's ranking is a combined rating of many or all of these aspects. 
Apperently, no one city can be perfect in all aspects, so when it comes to individual with different needs, a fixed city ranking might not be suitable for everyone.
For instance, for a freshly graduated student, a city with the most job opptunitis might be his/her first choice.
As for a family with young children, safety and education might be more important than employment rate.
In the case of a person who is about to enjoy his/her retirement life, a city's safety, friendlyness and low cost of living might be the major consideration.

What I do:
    Collect data(crime rate, employment rate, etc) from multiple cities, assign customized priorities to different aspects, then give a re-ranking to the cities, so that the ranking would make more sense to people with different needs.
